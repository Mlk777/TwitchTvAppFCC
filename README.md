# **Project : Twitch TV App**

Last of the four projects in the intermediate FCC front end development project section.

The goal was to request the [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/directory) api and display the status of some user. I had to respect the following user stories :

- `You can see whether some users in the list are streaming on Twitch.Tv`
- `It's possible to click on the status output to be sent directly to the user's channel.`
- `If a user is online it's possible to see some additional information about what's currently streamed.`

You can see the project [here](https://mlk777.github.io/TwitchTvAppFCC/)

## **Getting Started**

### Installing

This repo is using [browser-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync). It's watching all files and reload whenever there's a change in the code.

Once you cloned the repo, run

```javascript
yarn install
  or
npm install
```

Make sure you have Node installed then you're all set.

## **Features**

- `If a user is online, his status is green and you can see additional information in a tooltip by hovering your mouse over the sign.`

### Design

I wanted to have some fun on this one, so I designed it like a wooden road sign.
